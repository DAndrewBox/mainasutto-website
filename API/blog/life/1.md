# More than a month later, I'm here again :giggle:

Since I moved to Canada I haven't been able to work in the game. It's been almost 2 months already since my last public update here, but I want you to know that I'm working in other stuff game-related :hf_sweat:, but since I don't have access to a better computer than a notebook I did bring with me, and that I'm still doing a lot of legal stuff from time to time while looking for a job here, I just haven't had the time to just sit and work on it for hours or get in "the zone".

Sorry about that and hopefully I can recover this 2 months later on and could keep working on the project. :hf_sad:

In the mean time, I want you to show some screenshots for the new mainasutto webpage and newsletter/blog where I recompiled every progress post and update I've published on different forums, discord and blogs on just one page.

Hope you like it! :wb_yay:

## Hi everyone, long time no see

I'm not dead by the way, I'm moving to Canada next week and this last month has been only selling everything on my country and moving a lot of things from here to there. Soooo... I just scheduled some twitter posts for the month, but I'll probably be out for like, at least 1 more month since I've a lot of legal stuff to do after arriving in Canada :hf_sweat:

Sorry for any inconvenience. I love you all guys, thanks for the patience with the game! :yay:

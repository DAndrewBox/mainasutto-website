## Hey everyone! :coffee:

So since 2017 i wanted to do this kind of videos, but i finally had the time to. This is the first Mainasutto Devlog Video.
My english pronunciation isn't the best, but I needed to do it this way to try to reach more people in other gamedev communities, I hope to improve this with time.

Also, thank you very much to all who continue supporting the development of the project. ❤️

Hey, thank you very much!
I always tried to add these touches of Castlevania, especially Symphony of the Night, since it's my favorite game, hahaha.

I'm glad you liked it! The demo really is not much and it's pretty outdated (I think it's been almost a year and a half), however, I'll try to upload a new one in July! :smiley:

## S P A R K - P A R T I C L E S

I added a particle system in the prologue to signal a bit of warmth and that "epic in-coming" feeling, and to feel a sense of wind above the clouds. In addition, I added a layer of clouds from the front, to give a greater depth effect.

What do you think?

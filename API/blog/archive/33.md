## Hey everyone, how are you?

I'm on my way to leave a couple of updates taking advantage of a dead time in the university :giggle:

## C U T S C E N E S

As you know, I was testing a [new cutscenes system](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=58476.msg1373579#msg1373579) for certain events and presentations of important characters in the story. And with this I decided to redo the main cutsene of the beginning of the chapter 1, including a system of "self-movement" in which the player has no control of the actions of the character on the screen.

<div class="image-container">

(New "Meet Mr. E" cutscene)

</div>

You can also see a couple of changes in the visual side at the beginning of the gif. :smiley:

Another not so notorious change, is that now you won't choose the name of the character until this cutscene, so during the beginning they will call you in another way giving a little more knowledge of the story of the character you use. :wink:

(Name selection cutscene)

</div>

I also added a couple of keywords that can be used in name to modify some stats and game modes. For example, there is a name which will allow you to play with 100 points of luck (50% chance of extra drop and 75% chance of critical hit.) from the start, however, it will reduce the rest of your stats to 1 (except life and stamina that reduce to 25hp and 10sp)

## Hey everybody!

Recently I had little time to advance in the game (because I'm in my last weeks of the university semester), so instead of moving on things regarding plot or story, I focused on fixing a couple of visual details. :smiley:

I realized that although the skills (or combos as I previously called them) were already included in the game, there was no concrete way to know when one of these was activated, for example, in the case of the "Ultra jump" , you could only see that the character was jumping a little higher, but it didn't show that he was completing a sequence of keys for a skill or something.

Same case with the "Rotating Sword Dash", which only showed the player advancing faster in a straight line, but didn't show the sword spinning or any similar visual effect.

So I decided to add a couple of sprites and shadows that are drawn on the screen every time the player makes one of these skills. You can see in the little bit of inspiration of Castlevania SotN in these two specific skills.

## Woah, there's a long time from the last update.

I actually decided to make **updates weekly only**, and post it **every saturday** by the way. :shrug:

So, here we go, a **big update post**!

---

First of all, I started to work on the **Equipment Menu**, on the **Pause system**, with some references to Castlevania games, and inspired on some MMORPG that I was playing lasts weeks, plus the weapon leveling system of Cave Story, I make a mockup of this, and looks like this.

And it'll work on a "3-block setup", and when you press the confirm button, will appear the inventory above the stats, to choose the weapon to use. Also, **you can't have 2 times the same weapon**, so, every time you get a weapon that you already have, this weapon will be trasformed in experience points to the weapon, that's the one of the ways to **level up the weapons**, the other one will be with an NPC and the Score system.

So, I spend 2 days on the programming of the mockup of this, and it looks like what I show on the video.

But I wasn't happy about how it looked, so I amke a few changes on it, first of all, I satured a bit a few colours, next I make the font a bit smaller than the original mockup, and the option to change the background colour to whatever colour you want. So, finally add a "background texture" to the menu, and the result was this.

And after programming it, changing a few things of the code, makes it looks like this.

After that, I made a mockup of the options menu, and with a few options that I guess, will be the only options if you don't have anything more on mind to add, and looks like this.

Maybe **I'll add different backgrounds for every orb/option** to choose in the main menu of the pause system. :smiley:

Also, some features that I'll love to work to make the game optimizable to every computer is the particles, the frame rate selector and the V-sync.

Finally, we actually decided with the team that the 2nd Demo of Mainasutto will be released later this year, so, keep an eye on this months to see what coming next. :wink:

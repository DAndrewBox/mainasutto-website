Last weekend I was so busy on my coming back to home, so I didn't post anything about, but already I did just a few things in the game because I haven't time to use my laptop in my grandma town's. :sad:

Anyway, I'll show you the few updates, and _ironically_, including one of the most relevants features in the game.

The first thing that I did this week was work with the backgrounds and some extras to the demo cavern, also, I did a better bloom shader based in the last one that I posted, also, the background pallete was based on the Underground Caverns of Castlevania Symphony of the Night as you can see.

Also, I did a Time Stop skill based on Jojo Bizarre Adventure (DIO's Za Warudo), that the ones that already know about it, will complain a bit, 'cause this skill won't stop the time at all, just makes it a 95% slower, but the effect makes it feel like the time stop by the clock of CV:SotN.
I don't have too much words to describet it, so I leave a video here. :smiley:

This was made adding a global variable called `TIMESPD` (basically time speed). It controls the image speed, the alpha speed and the regular movement speed of almost everything on the game, except the player and some NPCs that would known how to control the time (or at least for a few seconds).

ALSO, this skill will be upgraded along the game, it'll start in 1 second of time freeze, and could be upgradeable in the best path to 9 seconds, spending a lot of stamina for every second.

By the way, you need to do a combination of keys to activate it, maybe I will leave it here: `up down up down left right left right backdash`.

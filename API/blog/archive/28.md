## WOAH!

It's been a long time since the last update, I was very busy to be honest, but now I would do weekly posts again (hopefully) :giggle:

So, first of all, I want you to know that I'm gonna start to do this devlog's entry in a video format and publish it like some kind of serie in my youtube channel, so, if you're interested, you can take a look of this. :smiley:

## Well now... What's new?

Since september 19th, a lot of things happened and were added to the game, bosses, rooms, textures, new mechanics, and some things that I'll save to the first episode of the video-devlog. :smiley:

So, I'll start with the first thing: I worked in some kind of _Project Schedule_ according to my free time, and how much I could advance in Mainasutto on certain dates, so I did a small scheduling of certain events.

Yeah, as you can see, I haven't plans to finish the game before 2018 (u know, it's hard to be indie), but I have a few plans to do in that year, like another public demo and a Kickstarter/crowfunding campaing.

OH, yes. By the way, tha first album of tracks were released days after the last post, sorry for don't post anything about it. :sad:

[You can listen it on bandcamp for free](https://456s.bandcamp.com/album/mainasutto-prologue-chapter-1), or watch the playlist on the youtube video below!

Also, I don't remember if I told you, but I created a playlist on youtube called "[Reference music to Mainasutto](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpQxaRq1YhUbh5i4pdBEMgkjOBocIHhSJ)", so, there it's if you wanna listen it, maybe you will hear some similar tracks to the ones in the album. :smiley:

## Now, about Mainasutto...

Recently, I finished the Prologue stage, in which you play as Kvol in the last stage of Graveyard Garden (That's why I want to finish Graveyard Garden before continuing with Mainasutto in January.), now I just need to work in the tilesets and backgrounds (as you can see, I'm using test tilesets for now), but everything else is done :smiley:

Also, as you can see in that gif, I added a new kind of blocks of (8x16)px and some mid-slopes to create better caverns and nature-kind of rooms. You can see it in this image below.

(It really works!)

Leaving a bit of the prologue, I finished (almost) the work with the first sub-boss, White Body. As you can see in the gif, there are still errors like black bars, but the truth is minimal.

As you can see in this image, it has 5 different attacks and... Well, that's all.

## However...

I really want to show you everything I did this months, but I think it's better to show you in the video-devlog that :smiley:

Anyway, thanks you all for staying tuned even with my inactivity in the forum. <3 :coffee:

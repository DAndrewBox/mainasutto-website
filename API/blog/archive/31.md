## Heya!

I didn't forget to post, actually I was a bit busy with a hackathon outside the city, and I came back yesterday...

So... Here is the next devlog entry! :smiley:

I'm sure you'll be interested to know this if you're a novice dev or have never applied particle systems to your projects!

_(PD: I didn't won. :shrug:)_

## N E W P A R T I C L E S Y S T E M

This is a topic that I really would like to expand on, because it's a mistake that many devs make for not wanting to leave our comfort zone, as you can see in the title, I talk about particle systems.

While there are different ways to create one of these, not all are optimal and some are simply unnecessarily complicated to do the same as you would with a traditional or integrated into the engine you are using, this is my case and how I managed to reduce up to 8000 Instances per room to only 1 thanks to the particle systems.

First of all, I'll leave you a video in which you can see the difference of both versions in a midhigh-tier PC (spoiler: not much difference)

As you can see, the save animation generates a lot of particles which move in different directions and create a trail of particles of a particular color each, not randomly. This process during several demos was called by the testers as "the benchmark of Mainasutto", because if your PC ran this animation optimally, you could run the rest of the game without serious FPS drops.

As I mentioned before, due to staying in my comfort zone, this animation was generating it by 1 object per particle, including those of the trail that they left, so that approximately 4 frames were generating 144 new objects on the screen, each one with its own variables and colors, using too much CPU and basically, for PC low-tier (PC from 2012 or before) the FPS could drop from 48fps to 2fps and even 1fps (Actual experience tested on a PC of that time). In addition to this, we must say that the game was also creating as separate objects the yellow particles that float in the cave, and the trail left by the player to move, with all this at the time of saving, exceeded 8,000 and even, in moments reached 10,000 instances per second during the save process only.

I realized this quite a lot, but it was a topic that I did not want to touch since I did not have much experience in particle systems and I had never really used the integrated ones in Game Maker. However, a week ago I gave myself the time to spend all day learning about it and thanks to both [this article](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/216754758-Quick-Start-To-Programming-Particles) and the [Particle Designer 2.5](https://alertstudios.com/particledesigner/) program I managed to replace all the objects with a single global particle system, which brought with it many benefits.

Talking about performance for the game on low-tier PCs, the most notable is that now instead of drop the FPS down to 2 real fps, this simply does not drop more than 1fps in total during the whole process, including now, unlike previous demos, it's generated in 2 different views due to the radial blur shader applied, and the book of the center is also animated when saving.

Another thing to note is that by using this system for the whole game, I have been able to generate a better trail for the player, which is longer and can be seen better in movement (seen at the beginning of the video on the left), including also that thanks to this less instances are generated, so much less CPU and RAM are needed.

This being one of the biggest benefits, lowering the RAM usage of the game from ~60MB to an average of 7MB.

And well, really that's all for the moment.

Being honest I hope I can help someone with this entry, because the particles systems, besides looking good, help a lot to the performance of your projects and in the long run they are much easier to apply than to be generating a new object for everything.

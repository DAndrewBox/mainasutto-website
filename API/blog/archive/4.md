I'm having a lot of troubles to resume the project 'cause university things, so, on these days I was making a simple battle system and adding stats to the player, making an algorithm like:

```gml
(Player_STR + weapon_ATK) - Enemy_DEF = Total_damage
```

So then, I decided to add the `is_crit` var, which makes that the hit was affected by the Player's luck stat. Making thing a bit more complex, like, if your LUCK value is less or equal to a random number between 0 and 100, then:

```gml
(2 \* Player STR) + (wpn_atk+(a random float number between 0 and wpn_atk)) - (Enemy DEF / 2) = Total Damage
```

Making it code takes me a while and a lot of testing, and a part of the crit code was like this.

```gml
if (!is_crit) {
  total_damage = clamp((global.STR + wpn_atk) - other.DEF, 0, global.STR+wpn_atk);
} else {
  total_damage = ((global.STR\*2) + (get_wpn_stat('STR')+random_range(0,get_wpn_stat('STR'))) - (other.DEF/2);
};

with(spawn_here(vfx_hitted)) {
  image_index = 4 - round(total_damage/100);
};
```

Creating the hit effect that you could see when the player hits an enemy on the video below. :smiley:

Also, the enemy is just a dummy slime that doesn't have any physics on this world and will be deleted someday. :shrug:

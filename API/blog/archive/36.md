## Hey everyone! I'm alive and this project too!

Also, tomorrow is my birthday again! Another year of life and another year of development of this project. :coffee:

Sorry for the lack of updates, the truth is that I've been making so much progress that I have not given myself the time to publish.

Anyway, I'll tell you a couple of updates and leave the others for the following days :smiley:

## W H I T E - B O D Y - F I G H T

Many of you know that this is one of the oldest battles and that is from the beginning of time in the project. However, I have given myself the time to re-do it again, once and for all.

In the following video you can see what the battle was 3 weeks ago.

After this, and send it to the beta testers, I gave myself the time to fix and improve many things, one of them was the HUD of the "generic" boss, and as you can see in the image below, it was much better. :smiley:

## N E W - M E N U - C O L O U R

Another thing to note is that during this time, I also gave myself the time to modify the menu. A lot of you maybe have seen it in videos, and those who have played the builds or demos of the community could notice that with the time that one passes in the menu, the color of this one turned from violet to some kind of dark-green colour.

I redid this code completely since I never really liked the result of the mixing of colors that was done with alphas, so I generated my own color mixing code using the RGB values, and the result was more than satisfactory.

In addition to that last, and to fit better with the development of the game, I changed it from purple to green, to purple to red. You can see the alternative menu version with red palette below.

## D I S C O R D - C O M M U N I T Y

I also made a call for beta testers in Spanish of the project, so I generated a discord community so that all those who are interested in knowing more about the project, being in touch with me, or seeing the updates in real time , can meet and participate.

In addition, I usually ask for opinions and show progress, or show discarded things in this channel, in addition to having a daily changelog of what is being implemented, removing, changing, arranging and ideas that may be useful for later.

If you are interested in entering the community, do not hesitate to click on the image below. For now most of it speaks Spanish, but it's because I never presented it to an English-speaking community until this post. :shrug:

Stay tuned, because beta testing on English will start soon, to release the Demo 2 before the end of August. :wink:

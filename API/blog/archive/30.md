## C U T S C E N E S & D E C I S I O N S

Recently I began to question how to makes it feel even more tense at the moment of having to make a decision, as well as being able to convey some expressions of characters that can not be given to the player or other NPCs during decision making.

So inspired by games in the [Megaman ZX saga](https://youtu.be/-jTSjqgN81E?t=96) I decided to make a similar system for certain dialogues and important moments in the game.

I made a mockup and it was like this:

So, I decided to adding it to the dialog box code, but it was a mess.
To be honest, I had to rewrite many parts of the code in the dialog boxes just to add this feature. However, I liked the result quite a lot. :smiley:

**~~I don't want this to die, but I'm really busy with the university things.~~**

Anyway, this weekend I didn't do anything with the game, just thing about some new things to add listening some Homestuck tracks.
So, when I was listening this [track in specific](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGbVlq0Fgvk) I notice the portrait image that it have. And I love it!

So, in reference to it, I think in make a game over screen similar to that, but I hasn't time enought to make the screen or a detailed draw of how I will do that, so I draw these 2 images below with MS paint.

<div class='image-container'>
<div class='grid-50-50'>

(Game over screen early concepts)

The first one will be the screen on the first 30 seconds, but after that I wanna start to playing a **game over track** (*something like a medley of the game tracks*) and make the player disappears slowly as you can see on the concept of the second image. Seconds after the song ends, the player completly dissapears and some particles explodes making the screen goes to white and restarting the game after a "restart" sfx that I'll use a certain cutscene.

So... That's all, I'll have no time to work on the game this and the next week. :giggle:

## New paths had open on already known places :hmm:

You can now go and take a look on the new and freshly released **Devbuild 23w36** on the ‚Å†`üîódevbuild-links` channel on the [Discord community channel](https://mainasutto.com/discord)!

---

Long time without a new devbuild, but hopefully next one is just next month since I'm working on the steam page and planning to release a full "Act 1" demo on December. (_I'll try :smiley:_) :hf_sweat:

**This devbuild is focused on fix a lot of bugs and add QoL improvements**, plus a small bit of the next area and should support _non-xbox_ joysticks, and hopefully fix a lot of issues from previous builds, also adding a small game over sequence so you don't have to restart the game after dying :giggle:

There are some errors you reported during the last 2 weeks like the small jump when you attack while ducking or some weird water mechanics, I couldn't solve all these bugs for this devbuild, but a lot will surely be solved for the next one!

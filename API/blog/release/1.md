## Hi again everyone!

A lot of time has passed since the last devbuild, but I'm here again! :giggle:

I had a few things on my life (I did a trip to Argentina & moved to a new appartment here on my country) but now I'm able to work on this project again!

**This devbuild is about the same length as the last one** but I polished & balanced a lot of stuff and finished the intro sequence. Also added a very early gamepad support, so you should have to have you gamepad connected before starting the game and open the one that is called `mainasutto_v053_gamepad.exe` to use the gamepad (_sorry about that, will fix in the next devbuild_)

Also, I recommend to clear your `%localappdata%/Mainasutto_v053` folder if you want to see more of the new content, but that's on you! (Will also make a way to automatically clean on the next devbuild! :wink:)

As always I would love to read your opinions & suggestions, and if you found any bug would be great to have it reported on the ‚Å†[Discord Community](https://mainasutto.com/discord)

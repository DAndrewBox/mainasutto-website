## Hey everyone!

Once again I came back with more frequent updates and builds of the game to play and receive feedback from you all! :giggle:

This is the first devbuild published! :coffee:

It's a very short kind of demo just to test some stuff I'm working on, on this case it's the first scene & the tutorial. **I'm planing to post a new devbuild every 2 weeks just to have you all updated about the progress of the game. :giggle: **

I would love to read your opinions & suggestions on the `#⁠💌devbuild-feedback` channel. Also, if you found any bug would be great to have it reported on the ⁠`#🧰bug-report` channel, thanks in advance :wink: 

**I dropped the file on the ⁠`🔗devbuild-links` channel on the [Discord Community](https://mainasutto.com/discord)**

Go ahead a take a look into it!

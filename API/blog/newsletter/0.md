## How's everyone doing?

I'm pleased to announce the first (_hopefully monthly_) newsletter of the Mainasutto project! :coffee:

I've been working on the project for a while now, and I've been posting updates on different forums, discord and blogs. I've decided to recompile every progress post and update I've published on just one blog kind of page, so you can check it out in just one place!

I recovered all the TIGsource devlog posts, the itch.io devlog posts, the discord updates and the blog posts I've published here, and I've put them all together in a single page. I've also added some new content and updated the design a bit. **I will try to keep it updated as much as I can and make this the main source of information for the project!**

You can also subscribe to the newsletter to receive updates directly to your email inbox from [the new home page](https://mainasutto.com/)! Just press the "Home" button on the top right corner of the page and you'll be redirected to the main page, and the just scroll to the newsletter section and subscribe! :wb_yay:

## Now, let's talk about the project!

During the last months, and since I moved to Canada, and even more, I think that a few weeks before moving, I haven't been able to work that much on the project, but, I've been working on other stuff game-related, like the new webpage, the newsletter, and some other stuff I'll be talking about in the future.

Also, I'm redesigning the game a bit, removing a bit of content and adding some new stuff, so I can make the game more focused and more polished. Some of the things I've been working on are:

### Steam API integration

This means that the game will have Steam achievements, some leaderboard functionality for the choices, and cloud saving (not for demos tho). It was honestly easy to implement but I had to learn a few new stuff.

### Pre-rendered shadow & light maps

This is just a technical thing, but I've been working on pre-rendering the shadow and light maps for the game, so I can have a better performance and a better look for the game. I've been working on this for a while now, and I think I'm almost done with it.

I also reworked the shadows and lights system, so it's more optimized and looks better using more blueish colors for the shadows instead of the blueish-black ones I was using before. Take a look!

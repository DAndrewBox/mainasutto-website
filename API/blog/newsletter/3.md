### September is over, and I have few news to share with you!

Welcome everyone to the September newsletter! I hope you all had a great month and are ready for the next one. To me it wasn't that really good of a month, but I'm still here and I'm still writing, so that's a good thing, right? :hf_sweat:

I'll try to maintain the same format as the last newsletter, so here you will be able to find the more in-detail information about the things I've been working on, the things I've been thinking about, and the things I've been planning for the future. While in the email you will get a summarized version of this post, so you can quickly see if there's something you're interested in and hop on to the blog to read more about it! :coffee:

So let's get started!

## Ceiling and Foreground Decorations

One of the most suggested and oldest fix requests from my backlog, the ceiling decorations. This month I finally fixed it, the foreground decorations are not fixed to the camera anymore and are much more visible now (at least compared to older devbuilds).

I made this visual change not by only adding a parallax effect for the ceiling, but to adding a multi-layer system for it, so it doesn't just stop at player's z-index/depth, but it also goes further front and back making it part of the foreground and backgroun decorations. In the end is just a 3-layer system, but it's enough to make this decoration look much better. I implemented it the same way as other backgrounds, but I added a small twist by adding a recolor shader to it, so it can be easily recolored to match the current theme of the scene. This way I can have a single sprite for the ceiling decorations and just recolor if I'll need to use it in a different scene.

Have a look at the gif below to see how it looks in action:

(It may be not so visible now that I look at it, but it's much better in the game, I promise!)

# Sleep Frames = Juicer!

Another small detail I re-added after removing it long ago are the "sleep" frames. These are some frames that freeze during miliseconds when the player kill an enemy, when landing a critical hit, and when it's hitted or super-hitted (A hit that makes the player fly away). This is a small detail that makes the game feel much more responsive respecting the player's inputs and giving more visual feedback to the player.

It's a small change I once had more than a year ago. I removed it because I over did it and it was making the game feel slow and unresponsive in some cases, the time I used before was to much I think, and it was being executed in the wrong moments (every player hit to enemy and every enemy hit to player). Now I'm using it only in the moments that I think could matter more, and I'm using a much smaller time for it (from a 1/4 of a second to 1/16 of a second, almost 4 times less), so it doesn't feel like the game is freezing a lot, but still gives a bit of time to react and stop going in the enemy direction, or to start attacking again.

It's a bit hard to notice the difference when you are looking to a video instead of playingm but trust me, it's much better now! :hf_sweat:

## Interiors (And How I Noticed I Don't Know How To Decorate Them)

During the first act of the game (**Act 0: Where Everything Starts**, name finally confirmed) Ebura has to go through a few "interiors" of the houses in the Waterfalls area. Some small shops, to collect an item and learn some stuff about the world. Things like that.

When I started making interiors, I just figured out that I wasn't really good at decorating these, so I made a lot of "background" 2-color kind of decorations, but didn't tried to expand too much into the details for the interactable objects and tiles because I always thought "well, someday I'll pay an artist to make a better version of this". But that day never came, and I'm still here with my aaaaall programmer art.

So why do I say this? Well, since as the player you have to see a lot of interiors during the game, I'm **begging** for help. I'm looking for some artist I can explain my ideas for the interiors and they can make a better version of it. I'm not looking for a full-time artist, but someone that can help me with this part of the game. Obviously paid, but I0m kinda on an indie budget so we can negotiate the price. If you know someone that could be interested, please let me know! :hf_sweat:

On the other hand, I'm also working with interiors larger than one room now, so it's kinda noticeable now how bad I'm decorating stuff. You can have a look at this video below to see how it looks now:

## More PLayer Movement Tweaks

Once again, another upgrade that is fairly noticeable when playing the game, but not so much when looking at a video. I completely reworked how player jump and fall velocity/acceleration works, so the player can now jump faster and fall a bit slower at the beginning but faster at the end.

Since one of the constant feedback I received from the devbuilds was that "The player is too floaty", this change aims to make the player feel more responsive and to make the player feel like it's easier to control it. Removed some of the "floatiness" of the player, make the direction changes more sharp, jumps more responsive, and the player feel more "heavy" when falling.

### Is This A Speedrun Strat? :hf_thinking:

While doing this changes, I noticed that since the player can now stay a little bit more time in the air while attacking, this can help the player to reach places it couldn't before. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but I'm keeping it for now.

Personally I think is good because more experienced players can use this to reach some places faster, and maybe develop some speedrun startegies based in this new movement. Or maybe do some sequence breaks and skip some parts of the game. I'll try to prevent it as much as I can, but if it's not game-breaking, I think it's a good thing to have and keep in the game even after release.

Not too many people know because I used a different alias long ago, but I've some background in the speedrunning community too, so I really like when developers add some speedrun-friendly mechanics to their games. I think it's a good way to keep the game alive after release, and to make the game more fun to play for the people that like to play it over and over again. :coffee:

See the video below to see how this technique it looks in action:

## 1 Year Since the Last Devbuild. Steam Demo Soon?

It's been a loooong year since my last devbuild published (v0.53.23w36), and the game has suffered a lot of changes but we are still working in the first act of the game. I promise I'll be working faster now that I have a lot of things figured out, and I'm not planning to make any more big changes to the game, so I can focus on the content and the story.

Having said that, I'm planning to release a new devbuild soon, I think at the end of the year, hopefully before chistmas so you can have a look before going into the holidays. I'm planning to release a demo too in Steam next year by January (if I find an artist before December), so your feedback for this one will be really important to me.

Said that, I will be testing Steam achievement's systems and analytics for that demo, so I'll be looking for some testers to help me with that. If you are interested in helping me with this, please let me know too! :hf_sweat:

## Initial Cutscene

Last but not least, as I said last month, I'm reworking the whole initial sequence reducing the text to minimum and making it more visual. There are a few changes I'll have to make to make it work right, but I think it's going to be much better than the current one.

I'm planning to make it a bit more interactive too, so the player can move around and test the basic controls before the Waterfalls area, maybe movement, jump and interactions, but not attacks. I think it's a good way to introduce the player to the game and to make it feel more like a game and less like a visual novel or a 100,000 words book.

(Concepts for the new initial sequence)

</div>

The idea is that in October I'll focus just in this initial part, and November in the things left to rework the Waterfalls tutorial area. I think I can make it in time, but I'll have to work a lot to make it happen. I'll keep you updated on this in the next newsletter and in the [**Discord channel**](https://www.mainasutto.com/discord), so stay tuned!

For now, have a few seconds of the new initial cutscene, I recommend you to watch it with sound, it's much better with it:

## BONUS #1 - Some More Concepts

Sometimes I like to draw stuff, I was very active doing these long ago, but now I'm more focused in software development and the project, so I don't have much time to draw. But I still like to do it from time to time, so the other day I had some time and decided to spend it drawing a few things related to the game.

I'll not say anything about these, I'll let you guess what these are and what they are for. I'll give you a hint, "Nova" and "Time Corruption". :hf_thinking:

## BONUS #2 - I Won an Award!

Last month I told you about being nominated for the "Best Tool" category for the GameMaker Awards 2024. This is a new category introduced this year, and I was really happy to be nominated for it. I was up against some really good tools and developers. I was really happy to be nominated for it, but I never thought I could win it. And guess what? I'm the first winner of the "Best Tool" category! :hf_happy:

I'm really happy about it and shared some of my thoughts about it in the GameMaker's page, so if you are interested in reading more about it, you can see [the whole post in the GameMaker's page here!](https://gamemaker.io/es/blog/gamemaker-awards-2024-winners)

I'll also have a small interview with them soon about the tool and a bit of Mainasutto too! So I'll let you know when it's published so you can read it if you are interested in it! :hf_happy:

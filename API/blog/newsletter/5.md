## A Whole Rework of the Game Story to Focus more on its Impact on Gameplay

This section is so important to me that I decided to make it the first one in this newsletter because it affects the entire game and how it will be played.

How it is expected from a game that is being developed for a long time, the story of the game has changed a lot since the beginning, at this point it already a lot of iterations, but some of these rewrote the entire story just taking some elements from the previous ones. This time we are not doing that exactly, but there's a lot of concepts that were previously addressed that we are removing from the game to make it less of a **feature creep** and more focused on the core experience, while also adding some new elements that would make the game story more engaging, and focus more on the character development and the world building for future projects.

**THE NEXT PARAGRAPHS CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS ABOUT THE GAME STORY, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED, PLEASE SKIP TO THE NEXT SECTION**

Here is a list of the elements that were removed from the game history and gameplay with this rework, and how they were replaced:

- **Time Travel Capabilities**: From it's conception, the game focused a lot on time travel mechanics, being one of the main elements of the game where the player could go back in time to "fix their mistakes" and "change the future". This was a very interesting concept, but it was also very hard to implement in a way that would make sense and not be confusing for the player and didn't impact the gameplay in a way that would make it too hard to follow along the story. So we decided to rework this story element, making it more related to how every action of the player choices "branch" the timeline, and how these branches can be explored in multiple replays of the game, making the game more replayable and giving more oportunity to explore the game world and the characters in alternative routes. The idea is to make the game more focused on the player choices and how they impact the game world, and also adding "story checkpoints" that will allow the player to start new files from these points, making it easier to explore the game in different ways without having to replay the entire game from the beginning.

- **The 6 Orbs**: For years, the story focused in too many things at the same time, aside from both playable stories, we had too many distracting elements like **the 6 orbs**, that were bonded to the **Souls** that are now transformed to **Essences**, and served as a way to slowly explain the relation of **The Souls Realm**, **The Medallion**, **The Book of Memories**, **The Doomsday Clock** and it's story behind the use of the orbs, **how the orbs were formed by crystals from the depth caverns** and part of the **Time Corruption** lore. I felt like I was trying to explain too much at the same time, and that was making the game story too confusing and hard to follow. So we decided to remove the 6 orbs from the game, and instead focus on just **the medallion** and how it relates to **time corruption** and the rest of the world, making **the medallion** the principal focus of the game story, and how it's power can be used to change the world in destructive ways. This aims to reduce the story cluttering and maybe, in the future if the game is well received, we can explore the rest of the lore in a future game or DLC.

</div>
</div>

- **The Doomsday Clock in the Sky**: This was added in very late iterations of development, the idea was to have this sense of urgency in the story where everything was going to end when a giant clock in the sky reached 12AM. This concept was interesting to explore and made sense at that time, but removing the orbs and re-making the story to focus more on the medallion, this concept didn't make sense anymore since now the major threat is the medallion and how it's over-usage is corrupting the world around and consuming time itself, and how this affects specially the creatures that live near the "timeloop core" (The **Reminiscense** rebels) and not the ones that live in the surface (The Council) and are not affected by the corruption... yet.

- **The Quests System**: As much as I really loved this system and there's still traces of it in the game code, the quests system basically served like a way for the player to have a more "open-world" kind of adventure, were you could do side quests that will allow you to unlock more equipment, learn more about the world and the characters, and do some tasks to help the people in the world. This is now "kinda" removed from the game. The game story is now more linear and dependant on choices that the player makes, so none of this quests will be required anymore and there will be no side quests but "rewards" for exploration in the map, with this I mean that you could find some NPCs during your journey that will give you some items or information that will help you in your journey, and will have some task that you can do to help them, but this will not be required to finish the game, but to open new paths and explore the game story in different ways. But this would not be tracked in a quest log anymore, or at least not in the same way that it was before.

- **Reduction of Equipment Items and Grinding**: During the development of the game, we added a lot of equipment items that the player could use to help them in their journey, like weapons, armors, accessories, etc. This was very similar to how RPGs and game like Diablo or Path of Exile works, where you have a lot of items that you can use to improve your character stats and make them stronger. The game will still have items to equip, but we are drastically reducing from hundreds of items to just a few dozens, and making them more unique and impactful in the game, and moving a lot of the previous stat changes to the **Souls** passive system (which works like the souls in Castlevania AoS/DoS, or like the charms in Hollow Knight), making it so the player can have more impactful changes when changing, for example, it's main weapon from a sword to a dagger, but can balance the stats with the **Souls** that they have equipped. This also reduces the need for the player to grind for items, reduce the choice paradox where you have too many choices and don't know what to choose so you just shutdown or save the best items for "later" and end up never using them, and the need of multiple potions and food items by making all the healing items to be just one type of rechargable item that can be used multiple times (like in Momodora RutM) in a secondary item slot.

</div>

- **Chapters? Acts? Game Pacing?**: This game was always intended to be a long game with multiple hours of gameplay per run, a 6 chapters story divided in 2 acts per chapter. With time, this changed to just be around 7-8 very long acts that would start with a multiple new areas unlocked and end with a boss fight that opens the next chapter, or at least that was the principal idea. Now a days, and after many rewrites of the story, the game is still divided in acts but acts are now more shorter and less grindy giving a better feeling of progression in the story and adding more "story checkpoints" where you can come back later to try new routes and decisions. Starting from act 0 "Where Everything Starts" and ending in tha last act "Where Everything Ends", also adding 1 small "prologue"/"flashback" act during after the middle game sequence, that could serve as a way to explain why during the first acts some decisions where made and will serve as a way to make the player motivations better. A lot of the story elements that were removed from the game would be told just by reading entries in the pages of the **Book of Memories** that the player will find during the game, and the rest of the story will be told by the characters and the world itself without relying in spending hours of dialogues and cutscenes to explain everything if you, as the player, just want to keep playing and you are not interested in the story that much, also leaving some open questions that can generate discussions and theories :hf_sweat:.

**HEAVY SPOILERS END HERE, YOU CAN CONTINUE READING FROM THIS POINT**

## A New Beginning & Extended Act 0

Since a lot of stuff changed in the game story, I decided once again to rework the first minutes of the game, not so heavily that it would break what was already made, but reducing a lot of introductory text and interactions, but making those interactions more playable, specially with the amount of dialogs you got in previous demos at the beginning of the game. :hf_sweat:

<div class="image-container">

![](https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//44656994/6d640606d824b7c598e98df085cc206832e05383.png)

</div>

One way to make this possible was to extend the first act a bit in terms of gameplay, and modify the **Souls Realm** introduction, so before having that whole cutscene walking you towards the story and how you take control of **Ebura**, you can move around the **Souls Realm**, fight some "enemies", have a small tutorial on controls and how to use the **Souls** and then you start making choices that will affect the game story, like previous demos.

<div class="image-container">

![](https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//44656994/0b0e46c88d535de4e7b5c9518d2c3538b80a4943.png)

</div>

Another thing is that now you are not just spawning in the **Waterfalls** area after the passing the threshold, but you have some events that... Hmm, this might be spoilers for the demo, so I will just say that you will now be avle to explore how people in the **Waterfalls** area are living, see a bit of "civilization" and a bit of explanaition on **why** are you killing creatures after leaving into the wilderness.

## Improved Camera System

So new camera system. That's basically it, but if you are interested on **learning more technical details**, you can continue reading this section. :hf_sweat:

One of the biggest issues I had with the camera and views in the game was how jittery it looked when the aspect ratios didn't match the game resolution scale, this due to the way the camera was rendering the views, and where it was rendering, so now instead of the game being drawn in a "game layer surface" per se, it is now put piece by piece into a pre-GUI layer, that can scale seamlesly without making pixels feel wanky or jittery. This also allows me to make the game run in a **better fullscreen mode** and can make it easier to port the game to different aspect ratios in the future (I will not forget you **widescreen players**, I promise).

<div class="image-container">

![](https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//44656994/d07dbd8d11672738c8b6a2db7105f994b5793399.png)

</div>

Another thing that this new camera system allows me to do is to apply zoom effects to the game, so now I can make the game zoom in and out in certain parts of the game, like when you are in a boss fight, or when you are in a cutscene, or when I just want to show a big open area that you can explore, and this will make the game feel more dynamic and alive, so less static gameplay and more dynamic camera movements.

Here's a look on how messy it also looks in the editor (lol):

## New Enemy Sprites & Animations

During this time, I started working with my friend [@klonoz](https://x.com/klonoz) in reworked sprites for the current enemies and bosses that fit better with the game art style (the previous ones were just programmer art), and also working in new enemies per area, to fill the game with more variety. Here's a sneak peek of some of the new enemies that we are working on, and their new and improved looks!

<div class="image-container">

## New Game Over Sequence

I think the Game Over sequences are like my kryptonite, I always have a hard time making them look good and feel right, but this time I think I nailed it. Inspired by Momodora RotM, I decided to just make this sequence something simple, you get hit, wait a few frames and explode, then you can see a game over screen with 3 options: Continue playing, go to menu, or quit the game. This accompanied by some "tips" or messages that will may help you to know more things about the game that you maybe missed or didn't know.

The idea is that you don't see this screen too often, but also if you see it, you don't feel like you are being punished for dying, but more like you are being encouraged to try again, removing previous penalties for dying that were in previous iterations of the game, but make it possible to play with those in a higher difficulty mode.

<div class="image-container">

## File Selection, Gameplay Focus & Difficulty Differences

This is still not finished because I want to add a crop of an screenshot of the area you are in, but, for the **new game** or **file select** option in the menu I finally implemented the whole difficulty and gameplay mode system that I have been testing for a few months now without a way to change it directly.

<div class="image-container">

![](https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//44656994/fb1dca3fe01880928c0bd422e24791982269b458.png)

</div>

The idea is to have an experience that could fit what you like most not by just tweaking some numbers, but by adding/reducing text and dialogues, tweaking enemy hitboxes a bit to be more precise or forgiving, and adding/simplifying more enemy and player mechanics depending on gameplay focus and difficulty selected!

I think is not needed to say, but this was heavily inspired by the new Prince of Persia game that I've been playing lately, and I think it's a great way to make the game more accessible to more players, and also make it more challenging for those that want to have a more hardcore or combat based experience, but with the twist that it doesn't change numbers in the enemies thus making the enemies "bullet sponges", but the way the game is played by adding more challenging stuff to existing content.

<div class="image-container">

![](https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//44656994/e2a884ae8832ec778267161314750028f84d6c96.png)

</div>

Hope this can diversify the gameplay and add some replay value :hf_sweat:

## New Map System

The map system has been reworked a lot of times, and I doubt this is the last iterations. Now with the changes in history, me trying to make the rooms more easy to view on zoomed mode, and the addition of **map upgrades** that allows you to put annotations and related stuff in the map, the map has become too big to just fit in just one pause screen.

So, I decided to make the map work by... "layers"? The idea is simple, when you are inside an area and open the map, you will only see the map layout of the area you are with details, annotations and other stuff provided by map upgrades, but, you can also press a button and "zoom out" the map (this is also an upgrade you can buy), so you can see all map without annotations more than where the save rooms are, and some information about what area is the one the map cursor is on.

<div class="image-container">

![](https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//44656994/fa222836188f0ba97dc5b655de3989dee341f7e9.png)

</div>

The idea is to now make the map completion a bit more challenging, but also more rewarding giving more feeling of progress during the adventure, and also making the map more useful for exploration and backtracking, and not just an image of where you have been, but a tool to help you in your journey... for a price!

Also, the map is now unlocked almost at the beginning of the game (mid act 0, about 10-15 minutes into the game) and not after the first White Body fight (mid act 1, previously being about 30-45 minutes into the game), but since White Body fights are optional, these fight will reward you with even better map upgrades than the ones you can buy in the shop in the early game if you win those battles!

## New Steam Page Art

Since the story elements changed a lot from the time the page was first created, I worked with one of my best friends and the man in charge of all social media art, [@MaldozMons](https://x.com/MaldozMons), to create a new set of art for the Steam page that better represents the game story and the vibes that I want to transmit with the game.

<div class="image-container">
<div class="grid-50-50">

![](https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//44656994/c8b5e0e3d4dc77f08f080e8780640e7f8cdd4fbb.png)

</div>
</div>

We did a lot of iterations to find the one that we liked more, some with characters, some with just the game logo, some with silhouettes, etc... But we finally decided to go with a more minimalistic approach, with just the game logo and some elements that represent the **time corruption** to generate some intrigue and mystery about the game.

The art is already live on the Steam page, so you can go check it out and wishlist the game if you haven't already!

But if you don't want to go to the Steam page, here's a sneak peek:

<div class="image-container">

## More Characters Concept Art

Along with the recent changes in the game story, [@MaldozMons](https://x.com/MaldozMons) and I decided to rework some of the old character designs for relevant NPCs in the game, to better fit the new story and the new game art style.

One of the most important changes was the redisign of **Kura** (previously named **Keybold**), the souls collector, he was originally a "ghost" kind of character, but now is more like a **bunny**, heavily inspired in mimigas from **Cave Story**, this change was made for lore purposes and to make it fit better with one of the character he had more interactions in hte early game, **Nova**.

<div class="image-container">

![](https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images//44656994/f50e851a44e36093fd299d55764563cb445760a8.png)

</div>

Another character that was slightly modified but improved in design was **Sammy**, the green flame girl. The new design is more inspired in a mix of **Sypha Belnades** from Castlevania Netflix's series, and the **Jadesprite** from Homestuck. More focused on making her look a bit less "friendly" but more like a powerful mage, keeping the "softy" look.

<div class="image-container">

## What's next?

A new demo is certainly coming soon, but I want to make sure that all the new changes are implemented and working as intended before releasing it. The original idea was to release it on January, but things got complicated and I had to delay it a bit, but I promise (and hope) that it will be worth the wait!

The idea is to release the Steam Demo during the **Steam Next Fest** that is happening this month, so you can wishlist the game and try it out for yourself, and see all the new changes that I've been talking about in this newsletter.

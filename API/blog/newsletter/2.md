### **A bit late this time, but here's the newsletter for the last month of development!**

Hello everyone! I hope you're doing well! :hf_happy:

This newletter is a bit different since I also icluded a bit of a life update about what's happening in my personal life with it as a dev-comment, but I hope you enjoy it and have a nice read! :coffee:

Before starting I just wanted to say that I'm sorry for the delay in this newsletter, I've been doing a lot of things lately and I didn't have time to write it, but here it is, so let's talk about the state of the game.

## 10 Years of Development

June 21st marked the 10th year of development of the game. I started working on the game in 2014 for a gamejam, and it's been a long journey since then. I've learned a lot of things, and I've met a lot of people that helped me to get where I am today. I'm really grateful for all the support I've been receiving from everyone that's been following the development of the game, and I hope I can deliver a game that you all enjoy playing.

But, it's been a long time, and I'm getting a bit hopeless about the game, everytime I go back to work on it I feel like I'm not doing enough, and I'm not getting anywhere. I'm spending too much time in making the game perfect, and I'm not getting anywhere. Reworking systems that are "already working" but not as I want them to do, not focusing on the game itself but in making me "easier to work on future updates", and yes, I know that it's important to have a good codebase, but I'm kinda not getting anywhere with this mindset.

During the last months I've tried to just start working in new chapters, sections or acts in the game, and even if theorically I know what I want to do, I just can't get myself to do it. I'm always thinking that I need to rework this or that, or that I need to make this system better, more "juicier", or that I need to make this part of the game more interesting because it has too much text, or tune down some systems because they're too complex and would be hard for new players, or too easy and will be boring for new players, or too simple and... you get the idea. :hf_sweat:

Even when I'm feeling like I'm doing progress, it doesn't feel like it's enough, and I feel like I've been trapped in development hell for a lot of years, even when I'm constantly removing features that I initially thought were cool, but in the end they were just a waste of time and didn't help to the game at all, making me going back to the start and reworking the game again and again, rewritting parts of the story, modifying game areas, and making a lot of unused content for the game.

I'm not sure if I'm just being too hard on myself, or if I'm just not cut out to be a game developer, and at this point, it has been about 14 years from the conception of the idea of Mainasutto, half of my life spend just in this game... And it doens't even resembles what I wanted to do in the first place! :hf_sweat:

But I'm trying to get out of this mindset and just start working on the game again, even if it's just a bit at a time, and even if it's just a bit of progress, I think it's better than nothing. :giggle:

So, anyways, that's a bit of a life update, and I hope you understand a bit of why social medias and the discord have been a bit quiet lately, but I'm trying to get back on track and start working on the game again, so let's talk about what I've been working on since the last newsletter. But not before showing you a how the last 10 years of development look in only 25 seconds!

(It's crazy to see how the game evolved in 10 years.)

It's crazy how some of the oldest video footage from the prototype is from when Sony released the PS4 in 2013 and now the PS5 is already at the end of its life cycle, and I'm still here working on the game. :hf_sad:

## Settings Sections & Controls Remapping

When you have the idea of creating a game, noone tells you that you'll have to create the whole game, that includes the settings menu, and it's a pain to do it. :giggle:

So last weeks I've been organizing the settings menu a bit more, adding sections to group the settings in a more organized way as I shown in the July newsletter, and I also added a new section for the controls remapping, so you can change the controls of the game to your liking. It's a basic feature that I wanted to add for a long time, and it was a pain in the ass to do, and being honest, I haven't finished with all details on the gamepad because of some issues with the last buttons pressed checks.

I think by next month I'll be having the remapping in gamepad done, but for now, I finished and fixed a lot of the issues with keyboard, and also added presets for QWERTY, QWERTZ, AZERTY and CUSTOM layouts!

## Less Blur, more Pixel

An error I think I made in the last devbuilds was to add a lot of blur to the game, the FOV filter, small blur when you get hit, and the blur in the foreground decorations layers, and after a few comments about it with other game developers, I decided to remove the blur from the default settings of the game and make it optional.

I had to do some changes with this because blur was also hiding some of the mixels I used for the foreground decorations (it was a non-evenly scaled layer), so for now at least the layer is now static in camera and some movements of small decorations are can be seen weirdly, but I think it's better than having all that blur in a pixel art mainly game.

Also, I reworked a bit an area that didn't convinced me that much in the Waterfalls area and helped me making it a bit more vertical and finally implement moving platforms, so take a look at the changes in the video below!

## Parallax Particle Layers

All of those who played previous devbuilds of the game may have noticed that all the areas have particle systems that are different depending the area you are, and that this particles were always above everything, the player, the enemies, and in some cases the GUI.

So, last night (_yes, I made this yesterday_) I was playing some Hollow Knight but not for the gameplay this time, but to look how the world was built, and I noticed that the particles in the game were not just in one layer, but in multiple layers, there were particles that were above the player, and some other particles that were below the player, and others that were completly behind some decorations in the game. This was some level of detail that I never thought about and created an amazing atmosphere, and I wanted to add it to Mainasutto.

So I started working on it, and I managed to create a system that allows me to create multiple layers of particles, and set the depth of each layer, so now I have 4 independant layers of particles that I can set the depth of each one, and I can set the depth of the particles in each layer, and every layer has it's own parallax effect, so it looks like the particles are moving at different speeds while the player moves in the scenes, and it creates a really cool effect in the game when you notice it.

I also applied this effect to the volumetric cone lights, so the are also affected by the parallax effect, and I'm really happy with the result!

I tried to make it as visible as possible in the video, but it's a bit hard to see it when you are not controlling the player and all the area particles are so similar (_I'm working on that_). But it's more noticeable when you are playing the game and moving the camera, so I think it was worth the time to do it. :wb_yay:

## Auto-Save Animation Label and New Cursor

Talking about small details, I few months (_I think_) ago I made a post where I showed the new auto-save animation. I really like the new animation since it shows basically 2 of the 3 most important things in the game in the story, "Souls" and "The Medallion", and I think it's a cool way to show that the game is saving your progress, but before it didn't had any text to show that it was saving the game, so I added a label to the animation that shows "Saving..." when the game is saving, and "Game Saved!" when the game is done saving.

It's something very small and simple, but I think it's a nice touch. :giggle:

I also made a new cursor for the game, the old one was a bit too small and it was a 4x4 pixel cursor, and it was a bit hard to see in some areas of the game, so I made a new cursor that is a bit bigger and it's more visible, but disappears when you are not moving the mouse, so it doesn't get in the way of the game.

I also learned how to zoom videos in my clip editor. :hf_sweat:

## Fall Recoil and Player Movement Tweaks

One of the critics I received about a year ago from a QA team from a publisher I was in talkings to, was that player movement was "somewhat floaty", this thought has been on my mind since then and from the last year I've been trying to make the player movement more responsive and less floaty, and I think I'm getting there step by step.

During the last few nights, I started re-playing some other metroidvanias that I consider good and inpiration for Mainasutto, I don't re-play this games only for fun, I mean yeah I've fun, but I also re-play them to see what I can learn from them on how they did stuff that worked and what can I make to make the stuff that didn't work, work.

So, I played Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight, Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia, Ori and the Blind Forest and Hollow Knight, and I noticed something that one may pass by, but it's really important in how the player feels, and those are 2 things:

- The player has a small duck/in-ground recoil after falling from a high place. (And it usually makes your gamepad vibrate)
- Jumps stop when the player releases the jump button.

This may sound like a small thing, but it makes the player feel more in control of the character and have more feedback from the game. And I never thought about it, but in Mainasutto as it was before, the player would just fall and keep moving as if nothing happened, and the jumps will keep going for a bit even if the player released the jump button because I was reducing the speed by half when the player released the jump button, and it sometimes made it feel like you didn't released the jump button in time, and it was a bit frustrating, specially during fights and precise platforming.

So I made some changes and tweaked the player movement a bit, and now the player has a small recoil when falling from a high place that is dynamically calculated depending in how much speed you had before landing (But it's still just fractions of a second, between 1/10s and 1/3s), and the jumps stop almost immediately (it's still multiplied but instead of 50% is only 10%) when the player releases the jump button, and I think it feels a lot better to controll now. The results are difficult to show in a video, but I think it's better to show it in a video than in a text, so here it is:

I didn't plan it to not have recoil when you fall into small ponds of water, but I think it's cool and Minecraft do it, so why not? :giggle:

## What's next? What we accomplished from last month list?

Last month I explicitly said this:

> **Here's a list of the most relevant things I'm planning to add in the next month in no priority:**
>
> â€” Finishing the ambush system.
>
> â€” Adding a few more enemies to the first area.
>
> â€” Rework the whole pause menu map system.
>
> â€” Implement the new cutscenes.
>
> â€” Add a few more environment props to the game so you can spam attack and break more things.
>
> â€” Remove some dialogs that are not really necessary and instead make them optional NPC dialogs.
>
> â€” Rework a bit the main menu screen to add the settings and accessibility to the menu.
>
> â€” Rework the player die sequence, maybe add a menu to retry or go back to the main menu.

Did I accomplish any of that? Not really, I did some changes to the game, but I didn't finish any of the things I said I would do, and I think that's the main problem I have with the game, I'm always trying to do too much at the same time. And to be honest I didn't thought about the ambush system at all this month because I barely had some time to work in the game because, oh, I forgot to mention but **I got a new job this month!** :wb_yay:

So, finances for me and my partner will be better from now on and I would finally have more time to work on the game without worrying about how I'm going to pay the bills, and I think that's a big step for me and the game. But I also need to learn how to manage my time better and since I'm now in a Senior position, I don't have that much time as on my previous job to work on the game during work hours, so I've 1-2 hours daily to work on the game, and I need to make the most of it while still having time to relax with my partner, do the house chores, and have a life outside of work and the game. As my partner said to me months ago:

> "You are basically working 2 jobs at the same time, your main full-time job, and Mainasutto which is basically a full-time job too with all the stuff outside of programming you have to do, it's clear that you will burnout if you don't [**take a break**](https://youtu.be/itKtosLoGk4?t=224) and have some time to relax and have fun."

And I think she's right, and that a lot of gaemdevs do this all the time, and because of untreated ADHD one of the things I always put last is my own health and mental health when I'm working on the game. I always think that I need to work more and more and more, and I never think that I need to relax and have some fun, even when playing other games I'm always inspecting how they did stuff and how I can do it better in Mainasutto, and that's kinda not healthy. So yeah, I need to learn how to manage my time better and have some time to relax and have fun, and I think that's the most important thing I need to do right now.

I'll not promise anything for the next month, but I'll try to finish what the list I made last month, and I'll try to have a new devbuild ready for you to play and give me feedback on what you think about the changes I've made so far before the year ends (hopefully). :hf_sweat:

## BONUS - I Got Nominated for a GameMaker Award!

This is a last minute thing that happened while I was writing this newsletter, but I got nominated for a GameMaker Award for the Best GameMaker Tool of 2024, and I'm really happy about it! :wb_yay:

As some of you may know, I'm not only a gamedev but also a tool developer, and I've been creating multiple open-source tools for the GameMaker Community for about 4 years now along working on Mainasutto, but this is the first time I got nominated for an award. :coffee:

The tool that got nominated is my [**GameMaker's Testing Library**](https://github.com/DAndrewBox/GM-Testing-Library), a tool that allows you to create unit tests for your GameMaker Studio 2 projects, and it's a tool that I've been using for my [**GML-Extended**](https://github.com/DAndrewBox/GML-Extended) project for a while now to do unit tests and know that anything has broken since last releases, but decided to fix a lot of stuff, make it easier to use and submit a public release last month in July. It got me by surprise that it got nominated, and I'm really hoping that I could win the award since there are a lot of cool tools that got nominated too!

**So if you want to help me win the award, you can vote for me [here](https://opr.as/GMA24-Vote)!** :hf_happy:

## BONUS - I Also Got A New Cat!

His name is Suki, we adopted her about 3 months ago, and she's a really cute and playful cat, and she's been helping me a lot to relax and have some fun too, and I think she's been a really good addition to my family.

I put this bonus section here because I think it's important to show that I'm not only a gamedev, but I'm also a person that has a life outside of the game, and because I haven't shown her to anyone on the internet yet, so here she is!

<div class="image-container">

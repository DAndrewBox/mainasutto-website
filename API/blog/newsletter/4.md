## October went so fast! ðŸŽƒ

I can't believe it's already November! I've been so busy with work and life that I haven't had time to write a blog post or work in the game for more than a few hours a week. I'm hoping to get back on track soon, but I'm not sure when that will be, hopefully soon.

I've been working on the game a little bit here and there, but I haven't made any significant progress. I'm trying to move on from the game beginning and finish the work on Act 0, but it's being hard since I had to make some changes in the story to match this new introdoction sequence, but surely it will be worth it!

## First Time Play Menu

This is a feature that has been in the game since the tech demo times (around 2019?), and it just evolved a bit right now. The first time you play the game, you'll be greeted with a menu that will be different to the one you'll see after you launch the game for the first time. This menu will have a few options: starting a new game, settings and accessibility, and quit the game. The idea is to make a quick transition to the first introduction cutscene from the Act 0, and then the game should start seemlessly.

In the last public devbuild (v0.53.23w36) you could already see something like this, but it didn't contained options, it just launched you into the game after pressing the confirm button. Now, you can see the options and the menu is a bit more polished, I think this will be the last or just previous to last version of this menu, so there shouldn't be many changes from now on.

I really like the vibe of this menu, it's simple, but it's also very stylish and it fits the game's aesthetic very well. I'm really happy with how it turned out, and I think it's a great way to start the game, so I'm excited to see what people think of it when the game is released since after you get to one point mid-game players will probably realise why the first time menu is like this.

You can see a video of the menu in action below:

## Act 0 Full Introduction Sequence

The introduction sequence from previous devbuild to the current one has been completely reworked. Previously you start the game and a lot of text and dialogues would start to appear on screen, initially I liked this idea when there was like 3-4 lines of dialogue, but after a lot of playtesting, I noticed that it was a bit boring and people usually skipped it anyways, so I realized that I needed to change it.

I read a lot of experiences from other developers and I noticed that there's a kind of "curve" of how much text you can give the player in certian stages of the game, and I noticed that I was giving too much text in the beginning. The "curve" projects something like "The player is less willing to read text in the beginning of the game because he's still not engaged with the game so the story doesn't matter to them, but as the game progresses and they become engaged in the gameplay, they are more willing to read more text within certain limits and always with a good balance of gameplay and story" and also "Always make texts skippable unless there is something timed inside your cutscenes".

So, what did I do? I removed the whole intro sequence and replaced it with 2 sequences, the first one is a small 7-10 seconds intro cutscene that will try to show the player something "misterious" to start the engagement, then the start menu, and then a seamless transition to the second cutscene that will be lead to the "pre-tutorial" area, where the player will be able to move and interact with the environment, but there will be no enemies or hazards, just a few dialogues that will not lock the player in position (so you can keep exploring during) and a final cutscene that will move you into the start of Act 0, where at the start you'll have a small interactive dialogue sequence where you can choose some options that will affect the game later on, and also decide your name.

My idea was to remove some of the tutorial basics from the Act 0 Waterfalls area, so you can start the game with a bit more freedom and less handholding, but still, have a good introduction to the game's mechanics and story. I think this will be a good change, and I'm excited to see how it will work out in the end and get osome feedback about it!

Here you can see how it looks like, at least the first ~40 seconds of it:

## Full First Time Play Menu OST

Erik has been working in the project for a while now and he created almost all of the amazing music you can hear in the game, at the moment he has composed about more than 85 tracks for the game in the last years (plus a few variations for those tracks so they could round up to 100!). This piece he composed a year ago is related to the first time play menu originally for an small initial cutscene and it is called "**Where Everything Starts**", it's a short track with a leitmotif that will be present in the game in some other important tracks in the game.

Personally speaking, I really love all the tracks that Erik has been creating for the game, but the ones with this specific leitmotif are my favorites, I think they are really powerful and emotional once the player learns the meaning behind it, and they also fit the game's aesthetic very well.

You can listen to the full track below:

### First Boss Animation Test

During the last month I've been doing some test animation to reduce the time I'll need to do art for the game, at least for the demos. I'm not an artist right now and haven't really been doing much art since around 2018, but I can do some pixel art and know a bit of animation and rigging, so I decided to do some tests to see if I could do some animations for the first game boss, **Tutoria, the giant ~~blob~~ thing?**.

So I bought a program called [Smack Studio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1739300/Smack_Studio/) that is basically a tool like Spine2D but for pixel art fighting games, and it allows you to do some really cool animations with pixel art, even faking some 3D effects with the right setup. I'm still learning how to use it, but I think I'm getting the hang of it, and this is the first test I did with it in about an hour or so:

(Smack Studio is a paid software, but it's really good for rigging pixel art!)

</div>

It's a bit rough, but hopefully I'll be able to improve it over time and make it look really cool. I'm planning to do a few more tests like this and also, if possible, work with some artists or riggers to help me with some animations (obviously paid), so if you know someone who could help me with this, please let me know!

## What I'm Working On? What's Next?

I couldn't finish everything I wanted to do last month, but I'm still making small progress on the game, and I'm hoping to have a new devbuild ready soon.

As you can see in the image below, I still have a lot of stuff to do before releasing a new devbuild, but I'm hoping to get it done soon at least after the middle of November. There's some stuff I want to re-do, but I'm prioritizing the new content and finishing the current features so I can start getting feedback from the community and also start working on the next Act of the game.

<div class="image-container">

![Tasks](https://i.imgur.com/FuNrk5a.png)

(Pending tasks from last month)

</div>

So, my main objective and tasks for November are:

- Finish the Act 0 "pre-tutorial" sequence.
- Add a game ending during the last sequence.
- Add a Game Over placeholder screen for player death sequence.
- Change the initial cutscene in Waterfalls area to match the new introduction sequence.

So with that said, I'm hoping to have a new devbuild ready by the end of the year, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to make it, so I'm not making any promises. I'm just going to keep working on the game and trying to make it as good as I can, and hopefully, I'll be able to release it soon!

As always, thank you for your support and for following the development of the game, I really appreciate it, and I'm excited to see what you think of the game when it's released. I'm hoping to have more updates for you soon, so stay tuned and don't forget to follow the game in social media! :coffee:

## BONUS #1 - 600+ Wishlists!

I'm really happy to announce that the game has reached over 600 wishlists on Steam! I'm really grateful for all the support and interest in the game, and I'm excited to see so many people excited about it. I know this is not a big number at all compared to other games, but for me, it's a huge milestone and I'm looking forward for the 700 or maybe 1000 next year!

I'm really happy to see so many people interested in the game and I hope it lives up to your expectations when it's released. :hf_sweat:

## BONUS #2 - Interview with GameMaker.io!

Last month I was interviewed by the amazing people of [GameMaker.io](https://gamemaker.io/), the official GameMaker blog, and I talked a bit about the development of Mainasutto, my GameMaker's Testing Library framwork, my experience with GameMaker, and some tips for new developers. It was a really fun experience, and I'm really grateful for the opportunity to talk about the game and share my experience with other developers. If you're interested in reading the interview, they'll hopefully publish it by mid-November, so stay tuned for that!

I'll share the link to the interview as soon as it's published, so you can read it and learn more about the game and my experience with GameMaker if you are interested. I hope you enjoy it!

## BONUS #3 - I Got a Promotion!

So, one of the reasons I've been so busy lately is that I got a promotion at work! I'm now a Team Leader for a small group of senior developers, and I'm really excited about it. It's a lot of work, but I'm enjoying the challenge and the opportunity to grow in my career, which is really interesting and challenging, so that's been taking up a lot of my time as well. I'm hoping that things will settle down soon, and I'll be able to get back to working on the game more regularly, but for now, I'm just trying to balance everything as best as I can.

There's not much else to report about this change, I hope it will be a good thing for me and for the game, since I'll be able to have a bit more loose money to invest in artists for the game, so I can fully focus on the programming and game design, which is what I love to do the most!

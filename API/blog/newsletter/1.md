## Welcome again to this 2nd edition of the newsletter! ðŸŽ‰

I hope you're doing well! I haven't been able to work that much on the project since the last newsletter, but I've been working on a few things since the last newsletter, and I wanted to share them with you! :smiley:

## Reworks of the first 5 minutes of the game

So I always had a mentalized idea of "showing" more than "telling" in the first minutes of the game, from previous iterations of the game (i.e, when you started playing in the tower of illusions before taking control of Ebura, or other iterations that started in some middle point of the game, etc), but I never really got to do it right.

Even with the last iteration of the devbuilds, I still thought that it was too much text in the beggining of the game, and I wanted to change that. So inspired on other games I've been seeing lately I started working on 2 cutscenes that would play the first time you open the game (or start a new file), these cutscenes should show first a bit of the main antagonist of the game, and then a bit of Ebura and Kura, showing just portions of the moment Ebura died.

For the first cutscene I thought on someting like the intro for Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories where you see the main antagonist "discovering" a kind of "tool" that would make him powerful. Here's the cutscene:

Forbidden Memories (PS1) walkthrough - Intro Cutscene" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

(The cutscene stars at 00:45)

</div>

And for the second cutscene it's not really inspired on anything, but I wanted to show some bits of dialog between Ebura and Kura, and then show Ebura falling from the tower where he dies. There's no cutscene for this one yet, but I'm working on it!

My idea for cutscenes in the game are more in a Homestuck style, where the cutscenes are more like a static image with a few animations, and I think it fits well with the style of the game.

## Improvements on settings menu

This is a basic change, but I've been wanting to do it for a while, but it's to add subsections inside the settings and the accessibility menu to group the options in a more organized way. I managed to do it, and I think it looks a lot better now! :smiley:

Here's how it looks now:

(I also noticed a typo "Resotre" instead of "Restore", I'll fix that later)

## New Attack VFX

Time passed and the old visual effect that was used for the hit animation on enemies was getting old, so I decided to change it. I was inspired on the hit vfx from the game "Hollow Knight" that are a lot more aggressive and I think it fits better with the game. Here's how it looks now:

I also added this vfx when the player gets hit and when the player hits fake walls or environment props but a bit smaller.

## Tutorial Ghosts & Essence Containers

I also added a new entity that I'm calling "Tutorial Ghosts" that are basically ghosts that will show you how to do some actions in the game during the tutorial by interacting with an old sprite of pillars that I had in the game for a loooong time.

With this I also added a new environment prop that I'm calling "Essence Containers" that are basically containers that will give you essence when you hit them, but are just 1 time use, so you can't farm essence with them. Since essence is the currency of the game, I thought it would be a good idea to add them to the game as rewards for exploration in certain areas.

The sprite was inspired on the checkpoints from Shovel Knight and [this joke post](https://x.com/mainasutto/status/1808252990937354387) where I multiplied the paticles x1000, and here's how everything looks inside the game right now:

## Barriers, Ambushes and Lamps

Long ago I implemented some barriers that would block the player's path until they finished the boss fight, it was never really used in the newer versions of the game since usually the bosses would lock the player in the room until they finished the fight by other means, but I decided to bring them back and make them a bit more interesting with another new feature.

Barriers used to be just like a red laser that would block the player's path and would works as the same as a wall, but now the barriers are basically "time corruption" barriers, where the player can collide and be hit by them (But it doesn't kill the player nor deals damage), and the animation is more similar to the time corruption effect thats used in the first area in the first minutes of the game. This also added a rework on the time corruption effect and surprisingly it is a lot more optimized now!

(Small changes in the time corruption effect)

I also added a new feature that I'm calling "Ambushes" that are basically enemies that will spawn in waves when the player activates a trigger, and they will spawn in a certain area and will try to attack the player, and will give the player a reward at the end. These ambushes are not random, they are scripted and will always spawn the same enemies in the same order, and the player will be blocked by barriers so it would not be able to escape the ambush.

The idea to have this features in the early game is to teach the player that they can't just run away from enemies and that they need to fight them, and also to teach the player that enemies can drop "Souls" that unlock new abilities for the player.

Lastly, I added a few more sprites for the lamps so they would look a bit more interesting and some areas would look a bit more alive. Here's how everything looks in the game right now:

## Small map changes

Since I'm modifying the first minutes of the game, I also decided to change a bit the map of the first area, so it would look a bit more interesting to explore, and add a small quest to retrieve an item, possibilities to meet early with a mid-game character, optional paths, and a few more things that could add some replayability to the first act of the game.

I also added a few more type of enemies in the first area, and I'm planning to add a few more in the next days, so the player could play more before another long cutscene plays.

And I'm also planning to make the room map sprite bigger as you can see in the image below, so I can later add more details and custom shapes to the rooms. Here's how it looks now!

## So what's next?

</div>

I've a lot of features left to add to first act of the game, and I think that when it's almost done (development but not art) I'll release a new devbuild so you can play it and give me feedback on what you think about the changes I've made so far! Hopefully next month or the next one. :hf_sweat:

**Here's a list of the most relevant things I'm planning to add in the next month in no priority:**

- Finishing the ambush system.
- Adding a few more enemies to the first area.
- Rework the whole pause menu map system.
- Implement the new cutscenes.
- Add a few more environment props to the game so you can spam attack and break more things.
- Remove some dialogs that are not really necessary and instead make them optional NPC dialogs.
- Rework a bit the main menu screen to add the settings and accessibility to the menu.
- Rework the player die sequence, maybe add a menu to retry or go back to the main menu.

# I've been working on other projects to pay for Mainasutto stuff

And I forgot to announce it here, but [Linked Mask has been released on Steam last year](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1111590/Linked_Mask/)!

If you like kaizo-like platformers, then you will love this game!

Also, all the art was directed and made by our amazing friend Klonoz (The one who made a lot of the enemy sprites for Mainasutto), and I worked mainly as a level artist, so please give it a try!

I hope you enjoy it! :coffee:

I forgot to mention. This game is connected to Mainasutto in a way, let's say, kind of a same universe, so if you like the lore of Mainasutto, you will love this game too!

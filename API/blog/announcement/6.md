## Hey everyone!

I've finally started working on the Steam page for the game, I know it's a bit late, but I wanted to have a bit more content to show before making it public. :smiley:

I'll be telling you on [Discord](https://mainasutto.com/discord) when the game is ready to be wishlisted on Steam! But I think it would in like 2-3 weeks :coffee:

Stay tuned for more updates!

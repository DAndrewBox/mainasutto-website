# I can't believe it's almost a decade since I started this project as a hobby.

On June 22th this year will be the 8th anniversary of the first demo release on Newgrounds! :coffee:

Take a look on how everything changed since the first alpha/prototype build (2014) until now!

It makes me feel a mix of emotions, from nostalgia to proudness, to sadness because of the time that passed, but also happiness because of the progress made. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this project, I just hope I can finish it before I die :giggle:

Thank you all for your support, specially everyone who has been here since the first public releases! (yes, I'm talking to you discord community :wink:)

Also, remember that you can play older versions of the project by downloading them from the [Alpha](https://mainasutto.com/alpha) and [Beta](https://mainasutto.com/beta) archive! :coffee:

But be aware that some of them are really outdated and may not work properly on newer systems, and some of them may not even have the same gameplay as the current version. :giggle:

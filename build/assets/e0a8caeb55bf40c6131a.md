Today I sent the first build to the new beta testing group.

It was a few weeks without publish anything of interest here, and it's actually because I haven't had too much time to make big posts or things like that like before.

So I'll leave an screenshot of how the game looks like at the moment, with the new colour shader and some visual implements that I did in my engine. :shrug:

Actually, I was thinking in hidden references more than easter eggs.

I mean, Mainasutto started as a Cave Story hackrom/fangame few years ago, and then I decided to make it an 'original' game. So, both are, theorically speaking, in the same universe. :shrug:


Also, I recently uploaded the last sketch of game intro, I need to clean the sketches and it would be ready. :smiley:

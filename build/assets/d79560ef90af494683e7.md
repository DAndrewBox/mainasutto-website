Another thing that I worked on at this time are the different types of weapons and enemies. In this case, besides working only on one of these or doing them separately, I gave myself the time to make a connection, an enemy that throws boomerangs, and that has a percentage of dropping a boomerang too.

You can see it in the video below.

In addition, working the mechanics of the boomerang that may be used by the player, and due to a bug, it didn't disappear when returning to its initial position, so I gave the characteristic that when returning to this position, the player could grab it again and use it

We could say that "I transformed a bug into a feature", although much of this game is exactly that. :giggle:

The truth is that this feature has another name, but I do not remember what are they called. :sad: _(update from the future: it was called a **Quick Time Event**)_

So well, inspired a bit in GoW that I was playing again recently, I set out to generate a system of interactive kinematics necessary to advance in certain moments of the main story, and the result was something like this.

I hope to soon be able to add bars that can be filled with "button smash" among other things like camera movements.

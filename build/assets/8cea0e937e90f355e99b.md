Few days without updates, but I was working so hard on make a lot of things!

First of all, I finally applied the enemy hp bar to the game, so you can see how it looks in game to choose one if you didn't do that. :smiley:

Next, added to that, I programmed the hp decrease numbers to the enemy and the player, with a fancy animation of appearing and disappearing and the hit animation. With that, I applied the critical hits as you can see on the video below.

Oh, and finally I add the "Watch outside the screen" (how like to call it) effect, it wasn't hard, but seems a bit buggy on the video.

I forget to tell two things, I use the "watch back" effecto to pick up some items, watch some signs and enter to certain doors.
And, yesterday we was doing some conceptual arts of a friendly NPC who will help you on your travel to unlock his best ending. :smiley:

## UPDATE

After a day of the release of the demo (thanks for the +800 downloads <3), a few people contact me 'cause they have some issues trying to open the game, and there's the solution of the 2 biggest bugs of the game.

### First

<div class="image-container">

</div>

On some old Windows OS like 7 or 8, this issue appear, even on the first versions of Windows 10, this is because some people don't have installed the last update of DirectX 9 (yeah, so old and maybe innecesary), and the solution is this:

[[Download the last DirectX version here]](http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=35)

### Second

There's some people that plays this kind of games in 4k resolution screens (This is a 256x192px game, why you do this to me?).

The solution isn't download something like the other one, but is a bit more... tedious.

- Open the .exe propieties
- Go to compatibility
- Uncheck the screen "scale if (...) of ppi" option.

Aaaaaand... That's all folks! :coffee:

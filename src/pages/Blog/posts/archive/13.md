## New week, new updates :smiley:

I actually want to work more on the game but I haven't a lot of motivation to continue it after a few things, anyway, I did some things that you probably want to know.

Actually, I'm still working _(and I think that I'll working at least 2 weeks more)_ in the **Pause menu** subsections. This week I finished the **Options/config and the artifacts menu**.

As you can see on the last post, I did a mockup of the Options Menu that includes a background colour option and a frame rate configuration, thing that this mockup have too, but on the final version **I remove the frame rate option** because run the game at 30fps besides 60fps made a lot of trouble with some alarms and codes (specially dialogs and doors transitions).

With this removed, I add a option to **switch between fullscreen**. So, I did the time to work on the spanish/english translation to the game, with the option to **add new languages on the future**. There are some screenshots of the customizable options menu on his final version. _(Also, the backgrounds are animated now, but I'll show it when I make the final version of the Pause menu)_

As you can see, **I also add a particles option with a %** on it, this was added at first as a debug tool that makes the game compatible on this _crappy laptop_ that I was working from last weeks of December and I'll be working almost to the end of February, but after watch the result of this in action, **I make it an option to the Pause menu, making the game run on 60fps** (without fps drops) only with the 50% of the particles on a Intel Celeron with 2gb of RAM even on the save animation (which creates 144 particles per second with the 100% of this option).

After this menu is done, I decided to start the work on the **Artifacts Menu**, these artifacts works, as well, as the relics system on _Castlevania: Symphony of the Night_, as key items that will follow the player on all his adventure, but he can deactivate, making the game harder, some artifacts would be necessary to get the true ending and other just will help showing enemy HP, run faster, double jumps, etc.

My first idea was made it like the inventory menu with an arrow below and make it as a big list with **almost 30 different artifacts**, but after a lot of troubles making it larger, I decided to make (at the moment) just 16 artifacts, **BUT**, a few of the could be selected by the player.

Maybe you're asking, How/what is this? Selected by the player? Well, as I said, you can only have 16 artifacts, but that doesn't mean that are only 16 artifacts on the game, some of this could be obtained by different ways, the best example is the "Ring of Moritzor" and "Ring of Verminot", if you see the mockup compared to the final version you'll see that they 2 use the same space (the 3rd space in the memory), but you can have only one of them two, and them have different effects on the game and can't be changed in the game.

And... That's all for this week, I guess that **I'll release finally the technical demo on first weeks of February**. :smiley:

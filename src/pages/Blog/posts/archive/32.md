## Long time no see...

I think I'll be direct with the updates from now on. Honestly I have been wanting to post a lot, but the university has taken too much time of my hands.

Also, I don't care much about the game, however, I had a car accident a while ago, and only today I was discharged and I was able to return to my home :sad:

But hey, I'm alive, so here we go with a couple of updates that I couldn't upload before! :giggles:

## T R A N S I T I O N - P O R T A L S

In addition to starting my work with the particle systems, I started playing with illustrations and in-game animations, you can see the result of one of these games below. I was supposed to ask if I used those portals as decorative in the transition rooms, however, I improved them and ended up using them in the prologue. **You can see it below in the April showcase**. :smiley:

Also, as several of you know, I started to work together with [Elisha Ramos](https://elisharamos.wordpress.com/) in the graphic part of the game, so all the design of scenarios that I had seen so far, has visually changed for wonders like the one below created by the fantastic pixel artist Elisha. (We also changed the prologue, you can see it below in the showcase)

## N E W - N P C s

Well, every good game needs NPCs to feel alive, and every good player needs secondary quests to distract themselves, so I implemented a couple of random NPCs during the progress. Among them is this one that mysteriously appears when you step off a bridge, but that was not really supposed to appear there (it's a bug tbh I'm looking how to fix it :giggles:).

On April 7th, 2018 I did a showcase of the prologue of Mainasutto, showing what was currently worked on this extra chapter and a couple of other things, and that although I only tell about on the Facebook page, it had a very good reception and a lot of people commented on it. Also, here you can see the final version of the portals that were going to be used in the transition rooms.

You can take a look below and comment on what you think. But, it's in Spanish, so maybe you won't understand at all. :sad:

**If you want to skip to the gameplay, watch the minute 16:09.**

I think that's all for the moment, I saved two updates that I published at the time on Twitter for the [#ScreenshotSaturday](). Perhaps I'll publish them during this week, this time I won't promise dates, nor will I say that I have returned :giggles:

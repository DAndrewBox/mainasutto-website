## Now, a "short" update!

I was complaining about finishing the menu screen or add new enemies, but I see that the enemies will take a long time to add without aclear concept of who I want to make to live in that zone, so I finished everything that was pending, the load game system and the configuration/options.

I was thinking about the load screen a few weeks ago, like 5 or 6 actually, but I hasn't time to make a mockup or something, so finally this weekend I made a mockup of what I want.

So, based on this, I started to make the first version of this menu, and it looks "a bit" blue. I mean, I love that navy blue colour that I use in replacement to black, but I feel that it was too "blueish".

If you don't trust me, just look at this.

Then I think, what could I do to make it less blueish without removing the blue tones?, s I figured out taht I need another colours in the scren to make the player focus on the bottom of the screen where I'll put the "instructions".
First, I tried with purple and fuchsia, but it didn't work so well.

So, after a while, I think that if a simple colour can't catch the attention, maybe all the colours can, and I did it like a gradient.
I didn't like it.

Because of this, I decided to make it change his colours gradually, and it works! (tbh I didn't think that it will work).
With that done, I focused my work in the settings screen and... I done it too fast, I mean, I just copy pasted the code of the pause menu options, and change some things like "colours" to a "language" option.

So to take advantage of the time I decided to make the load menu pretty, I figured that can add some particles to it, at first I wanted white particles, so I tested it with a substract blending, but it doesn't work as I want, it just drew some black squares. Anyway, I made the particles change color along with the background flash and it looks...
Fine? I guess.

And well... I added a texture to the brigther part of the screen just on a whim. :shrug:

[[ TL;DR ]]
I made a load screen and the configurations in the menu. Watch it in the video below.

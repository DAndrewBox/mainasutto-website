## Hey everyone!

Hope isn't too late on the week for posting? Because this week has a lot of uptades to see! :smiley:

This week starts with some spriting and vfx update and ended with it, the first I did is an intro animation to the player, as a "player start animation", I put a "[easter egg](http://i.imgur.com/FIa6ZQ8.png)" detail which can be seen if observed in detail the animation.

The animation, obviously looks better in game with the movement and the particle effects that it have.

Next, I started to work in the menu screen and it was really easy to do, but I change a few details from the mockup version that you can see in the previous post.

(Main menu with bloom [in spanish])

</div>

Also, I reduce the mouse sprite to 2px sprite in every resolution (it doesn't grow or shrink when you change the resolution).

With the "Mystery eyes" sprites added, I use the same sprite to add a NPC which explains you about the universe of the game when the demo starts. Actually, the universe where this demo is in, isn't the final universe and this things won't affect in the final release.

(Fun fact: It has been almost 2 years since the last demo was released)

</div>

So, I started to work in the rooms to the demo, I did the room design in as a mockup, and then I added to the game, and with it added, I started to work in the signs sprites, and the textboxes to this signs. As you can see below, there are the 3 different sprites and how it looks in game.

You can see also that the last screenshot haven't the bloom shader, that's 'cause this is how the game will look in the 'non-important' rooms, I'll use the bloom shader just in saverooms, transition rooms, and maybe bosses rooms.

I also change the view system, making it more comfortable, in the sense that you actually can see more things on the direction that the player is watching, almost 48px more than before. (The original system allows to see 1/2 to the left and right, now you can see 2/3 to the player direction and 1/3 to the other direction)

Next step was something that I was thinking yesterday and I spend almost 6 hours on complete it.
Maybe you actually know the Pok√©mon types charts. Actually, I realize that if I wanna make the game have more replay action and consistence in the universe logic, I will need to add types or kinds of damage, adding this to the boosts, and the weapons.
Also, adding a type to every enemy and his own weakness and strenghts. You can see the chart below, the damage dealer is in spanish at the left and the reciever type is in english on top.

(More types will be added later, any sugestion?)

</div>

It was really hard to did it, and I need to added 3 more scripts, to calculate the normal damge multiplier, the total damage multiplier, and the final damage with the enemy defense in.

With every type added to the weapons, I add some particle effects to the every kind of weapon, as you can see with the NORMAL and HOLY type hit animation.

(See better in the video)

</div>

Finally, I added a simple IA of a bat kind enemy which is DARK type, so, as you can see in the video below, it recieved big different amounts of damage even if these 2 weapons have only 6pts difference in their ATK/STR.

Oh, I and forget to mention it, I added some kind of locked doors, also can be seen in the video below.

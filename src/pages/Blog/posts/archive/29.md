## After 3 months without any update (here in the forum, the game actually progress a lot!), and a lot of times that I tell here that I'll use this more...

### I'm here again. :shrug:

## I N T R O

To be honest, for me it's a bit difficult to publish often in the forum, not because I do not want to, but because of the fact that it isn't in my native language, and I've to give myself the time, besides writing each message, translate it and verify that it's well written, however, I guess it is something that happens to many, so I will not complain about it. :giggles:

Also my idea was to start doing devlogs on video, and in fact, I already had an intro made for these, however, I did not take the time to record shots and / or write a script, so I'm willing to listen to tips respect to be able, finally, to make short videos.

To those who already do this, how do you do it? How do yuo plan it? Do you just improvise in front of the microphone or do you have any script? Do you have examples to inspire me?, feel free to share their video-devlogs if so. :smiley:

Well, now with respect to the project, it has had a couple of significant improvements in both performance, gameplay and graphic aspect. A couple of months ago I did a [post with a request for an artist](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=63585.0) in this same forum (sorry for not notifying here to interested) :sad:

And thanks to this post, I started working with the magnificent [Elisha Ramos](https://elisharamos.wordpress.com/) on all that is tileset and backgrounds, unfortunately, due to an NDA that we signed, I will not be able to show you anything until next month, however, I promise you will be surprised with progress. :smiley:

Now, regarding gameplay and what probably matters more. I will show two advances now, and the rest I'll upload them daily so that I don't have this post "left" and without updates any longer, but remember that everything that will be published in maybe next week, is only content that has been added in the last 3 months.

## H O L L O W

I was recently playing [Hollow Knight](http://store.steampowered.com/app/367520/Hollow_Knight/) and it surprised me a lot, especially because we follow the same concept of linearity of scenarios (Cave -> Deepest cave with crystals -> Underground garden). However, there is something that caught my attention even more, and it was the death system, which besides simply having to return to the last save point, penalizes you by creating a new enemy in the area where you died for the last time, and the one that at the same time, owns your "progress" so to speak so as not to spoil anyone.

I applied this same concept in Mainasutto, but in a somewhat different way; an enemy is also created at death, which is a silhouette of the player, however, this enemy has the base stats of the player as their own stats. In addition to dying you "SCORE" is reduced to 0, and the only way to recover the score you had is by defeating this enemy. Once this is done, you are given a stats boost depending on the number of times this enemy has appeared (starting at 100% extra and then dividing by 2 for each time it appears).

Here you can see a view of this enemy in action, it does not seem to do much damage at first, but, the more times it appears, the damage is even greater and your advantages are lower.

## P R O L O G U E

At the moment I write this, the prologue is already more than completely finished, however, I would like to tell you about everything that had to happen and the 3 different versions it had before reaching the final version, however, that It's history for a video-devlog :giggles:

Even so, I want to leave you with one of the most beautiful views that the final version has, next month I will upload it with the new graphic so you can compare it for yourselves. Oh yes, by the way, I think I've said it before, but if you do not know, the protagonist of the prologue and who will play, is no one else or anyone but Kvol (protagonist of [Graveyard Garden](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=57963.msg1283170#msg1283170)). :smiley:

Well, that's all for today's update, I will continue to do the updates in this style for a few more days, showing progress and what I said before, so be careful, especially the beta testers, because in a couple of days I'll send you a demo of the final version of the prologue. :wink:

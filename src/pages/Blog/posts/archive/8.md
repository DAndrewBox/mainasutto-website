After a week without any notice about the game, **I'm back.**

Well, without anything else to say, I'm gonna show you what I was doing this days. :smiley:

First of all, I worked on an H2O system when the player is on water, similar to Cave Story one. But these two have a **big difference**, on the Mainasutto's air system, when your air is on 0%, you start to lose HP instead of dying.

After that, I see that the character development on the game has a lot of changes, specially on the main character, so after searching on everyplace that I remember every remake and version of the game, I did this image showing every main character sprite along the time. :smiley:

Also, I finally added the save system to the game, which looks like the image below at the beggining, but the direction of every soul was too random.

So, finally I made it looks like this one. _(And the screenshot makes it look like an eye.)_

Anyway, other thing that I add on the game is the "key to press" sprite on game, as you can see, on the left is the sprite which you will apreciate when the gamepad is disconnected, and otherwise at the right.

(I'll need help with those sprites)

And finally, I make 2 new icons to the game, but I'm not sure to which could I use to the actual demo. So, if you have any opinion or critics about it, just tell me. :smiley:

Everthing that I tell you on this post, you could watch it in action on the next video.

And to conclude, there's a *secret link* hidden somewhere on the devlog, so, if want to be a beta tester, be the first on find and comment the video, good luck! :wink:

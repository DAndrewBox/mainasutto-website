Last night I was working on a new logo to the Chapter transition, 'cause I actually don't like too much the old one and I want to use a dark background with it (Actually the same colour that I'll use on the game over screen).

So, with a bit of photoshop and new colour palette, I did this. :smiley:

Added to that, I wanna put some "HP" bars to enemies of the game, and them will appear when you hit them, but I can't decide which one of this bar could use.

So, If you could help me with this could be awesome. :smiley:

## Hey everyone, how are you?

I'm on my way to leave a couple of updates taking advantage of a dead time in the university :giggles:

## C U T S C E N E S

As you know, I was testing a new cutscenes system for certain events and presentations of important characters in the story. And with this I decided to redo the main cutsene of the beginning of the chapter 1, including a system of "self-movement" in which the player has no control of the actions of the character on the screen.

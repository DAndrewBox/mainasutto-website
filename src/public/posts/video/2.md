The third part is here! I finally managed to implement a cutscenes/cinematic system + a Quick Time Events system.

I also show a new character design to the player, but i'm not sure about it, i would like to have your opinion. :smiley:

Thank you all for still supporting the project! As always, it means a lot to me ❤️

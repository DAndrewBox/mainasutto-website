Very long time without updates, I forget my password of this account and I was so busy lasts weeks in the project that I didn't even try to recover it. :shrug:

Anyway, **today is my birthday and a lot of things happened**, if you remember, I was about release the Demo 2 in mid august, but I didn't expect like I was thinking :sad:

I lost the last 5 months of work, so I took a week to go back to work, It took me 3 weeks to return to the point where I was, more than anything thanks to create a changelog file in which I wrote the daily changes I make.

...and I lost it too. :sad:

Anyway, there's the change lists from the last update that I posted :smiley:

First of all, I added an autoupdater to the beta testers (it'll be removed in the Demo 2 and the steam version by obvious reasons). It shows a message in the menu when there's a new version available. Also, to make this devlog less bored, I'll just post the images and put in the description the changes. :wink:

## TL;DR

I lost the last 5 months of progress but I did a lot of things and redo everything from the tech demo.
Take a look:

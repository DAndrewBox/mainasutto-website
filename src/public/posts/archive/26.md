## Information:

Due to some problems with image hosting services, some of the next small weekly updates will be text-only. This is because the hosting service I was using is not working anymore, and the media I uploaded on it is not available anymore, so I decided to archive all of the affected updates on this post.

This are the updates that will be affected by this issue if you want to read the original posts, you can find the permalinks here:

I'm sorry for the inconvenience, and I hope you can understand the situation. There's nothing I can do to recover the images. :sad: :shrug:

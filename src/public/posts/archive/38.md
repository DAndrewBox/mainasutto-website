## Hey everyone!

Long time without posting

Sorry for not posting since more than a year, i continued working on the project, but i moved to twitter since then because i was a bit busy and i need to do fast posts instead of long devlogs. :giggle:

But now i'm free and i'll use this time to do some posts to be posted 3 everyweek until i reach the twitter account explaining a bit more of things on the gifs.

A lot of things change since then, i changed the logo, changed the storyline a lot, added some protagonists, i moved to a new city, show it on local game events, got in contact with some publishers, and a lot of things i will try to tell on the next posts.

So, stay tune if you wanna know about what happened last year and a half!

## W a t e r f a l l s - A r e a

I decided that for the new area of the game, Crystal Caverns, after the interactive cutscenes that I previously published, the player would fall to this new area and would have to find a way out, since the path ahead would be blocked by a waterfall.

So I tried making a waterfall with a sprite tiled down and it didn't turn out very well.

As you can see, it was not tiled well and a couple of pixels were running to the right, however, the collision mask worked quite well.

So I spent a couple of hours modifying the sprite, adding (((a lot))) of fade, and taking inspiration from the waterfalls of some Castlevania games to finally get to this.

As you can see, it also has an effect of particles and bubbles in the water in the direction of the water flow, which is not only visual, but also reduces the speed of the player in the opposite direction!

However, as you can imagine, this is not the final result, but during the rest of the year, and thanks to the different modifications to the engine that you will see in later posts, the final result, with different particle effects for both the waterfall and the cave, it looks like this:

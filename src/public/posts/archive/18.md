## Finally, after months without any update I'll update the devlog, so this will be a VERY long post!

**TL;DR: SKIP TO THE END OF THE POST.**

After the demo I was over-busy with the university and a lot of things to do, but I'm here again.

Last weeks I was working in the game, fixin' almost everything that you sent me, so, at this moment, there's no bugs from the Tech Demo.

However, I'll write the changelog below with some images and features about the game. :smiley:

```
****** March 25th, 2017 ******

- [FIXED] Music still plays in the pause menu.
- [FIXED] Player can backdash during the transition-door animation.
- [FIXED] Player can enter doors while is reading a dialog.
- [FIXED] Bug that makes you die by air outside of water.
- Player now can go down in almost every platform.
```

I wanna stop here 'cause this is a great implement to the metroidvania feel that I wanna make, I was thinking that it could be harder to do, but it was really easy. So, there it's:

```

- Gamepad and keyboard keys are now saved in different files.
- Pause menu now keeps the last position after enters in a sub-menu.
- Now player can't change the movement axis in the settings menu.
- Now player can make combos and use skills with gamepad D-pad.
- Dialog char. Speed is now slower.
- Player backdash:
  > Invensible duration from 0.33sec to 0.50sec.
  > Speed from 3(px/s)*0.90(per frame) to 5(px/s)-(0+(spd*0.1))
```

```
****** March 26th, 2017 ******

   > Speed in "frozen" time from 5% to 1%.
   > Now player can't die by enemy damage while time is stoped.

- Bar aside the inventory sub-menu.
- Breakeable candles:
   > Drop system added.
   > Hearts & Stamina.

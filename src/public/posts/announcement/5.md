## Hello everyone!

I have been quite inactive these past weeks, to be honest, I haven't been able to work much on the project since I was finishing details of my university thesis, and it has been quite a chaotic experience, haha. :giggle:

Regarding Mainasutto, I have been working on a tool to help me test and modify things without having to run the game every time I make a change. Instead, I can make the changes in-game and save myself a good couple of minutes per execution. I'll update you on how that is going in the next few days. :coffee:

Thank you all for your patience, and I hope to have a new devbuild ready in about two weeks, which may be either devbuild 23w22 or 23w23! :smiley:

Before I forget, I finally created a [page for Mainasutto on IndieDB](https://www.indiedb.com/games/mainasutto-im-not-alone).

I hope you can take a look and let me know what you think! :coffee:
